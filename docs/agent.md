# sliver-agent

The per-user session agent (ADR-0001). It resolves the user's config for the current context,
runs modules, renders frames with sliver-render, and presents them to sliverd over the private
IPC (api.md §6). Owner of the core loop: ash (T24).

## Shape
```
config (sliver-config) ─resolve(layer, ctx)─► zones of ModuleInstances
   └─ modules.rs: module runtime ─► Cells (content, classes, width, touch kind, bindings, next change)
        └─ frame.rs: Scene ─► sliver-render ─► image + all-pressed image + regions
             └─ link.rs: ShmBuffers ─present─► sliverd   (◄─ touch / fn / display / hatch / ping)
agent.rs: the sans-IO core that ties it together. main.rs: config/stylesheet loading + poll loop.
```
- **Two IPC layers.** sliverd's `base` slot shows the top custom layer (or `base`), and its
  `fn` slot shows config layer `fn`. sliverd swaps them on Fn by itself.
- **Key modules are key regions.** A module whose only binding is "tap → key, fire on press"
  becomes a sliverd `key` region, so Esc and the F-keys never wait on the agent and keep working
  if it hangs. Everything else interactive becomes an `agent` region for gesture recognition.
- **Regions** are full height and reach up to 12 px into neighbouring gaps (split in the middle),
  so near-misses count but empty bar space doesn't.
- **Power (invariant 3).** Nothing renders unless something changed. The only timer is the
  earliest `next_change` of a module (clock ticks), and there are none while the display is off.
  The link drops frames whose pixels and regions didn't change, coalesces frames while sliverd
  hasn't confirmed the last one, and sends damage spans.
- **Stylesheet:** the built-in `sliver` theme, then `style.css` next to the config (or
  `stylesheet = "…"`) on top.
- **Config errors** fall back to the built-in defaults (last-good fallback comes with hot
  reload, T26).

## Running
```
sliver-agent --render out              # headless: out-base.png, out-fn.png (system fonts/icons)
sliver-agent [--config FILE] [--socket PATH]
```
Tests: `crates/sliver-agent/tests/agent.rs` runs the real link against `sliver_ipc::fake::FakeDaemon`
(real socket, memfds, validation, touch routing) and snapshots frames (`SLIVER_BLESS=1`).

## Status
Works: key, clock, spacer, custom (static `format`), groups (closed drawers show their handle),
icons (XDG theme → built-in fallbacks), `--render`, the real sliverd loop.

Not yet: gestures on agent regions and actions (T24 step 2); session/desktop context and
data-backed modules (battery, sliders, mpris, audio…), the public D-Bus API (`sliver_api`), user
modules runtime (T21), hot reload (T26).
